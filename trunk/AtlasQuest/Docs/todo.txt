ToDo & Notes List
=================

- AlphaMap: Not all DM & SM quests shown since AlphaMap doesn't split up SM maps.
- Some quests don't link properly. Though I believe it a server issue as with item links, I plan to investigate further in the future.

- Note: Need location of Omarion in Naxx for Inst15Quest6. Deathknight Wing - where? HA. Irrelevant now. Alas poor Naxx, we barely knew ya.
