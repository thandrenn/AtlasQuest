nonameform's list:
BRD/MC
ONHOLD - Worth moving A Binding Contract to Blackrock Depths since NPC that starts this quest is in the Grim Guzzler.
ONHOLD - Worth adding Rocknot's Ale to Blackrock Depths since this quest is (a) repeatable three times every run and (b) one of the possible ways to pass the Grim Guzzler.
Not doing:
NO - Worth moving Disharmony of Flame to Blackrock Mountain (Entrance) since NPC is not inside the instance.
NO - Quest Dark Iron Legacy is a follow up to Dark Iron Legacy which is worth adding to Blackrock Mountain (Entrance).
